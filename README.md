# Mobile Development Applications

The following Mobile Applications were tested, debugged, and implemented using the integrated development environment: Android Studio.

##### Mortgage Advisor App
The UI requests the user to input the principle, amortization, and interest of their mortgage. The app outputs an analysis which consists of showing monthly payments required as well as the balance still owing if the user chooses to terminate their mortgage on the nth anniversary (where n is a number the user can input). This app allows a mortgage holder user to determine the best time to terminate their mortgage if they are thinking of doing so. 

##### Mortgage Calculator App
The UI requests the user to input the principle, amortization, aand interest of their mortgage. The app outputs the monthly payments required (in dollars) for the provided mortgage rates. 

##### BMI App
The UI (User Interface) requests the user to input their weight  and height. The resulting output is the BMI of the user. 


##### Quiz Minigame App
The UI displays a question pertaining to the capital of a city. The user inputs their answer and a scrollable log is shown which outputst the correct answer. The quiz repeats this for up to four questions where the user can get a maximum perfect score displayed of 4/4. 

##### Encryption App
This app allows for a user input-generated string/notes to be encrypted and likewise decrypted.

### Apendix

-> The UI of the Mortgage Calculator, BMI, and Quiz Minigame App can be seen in the "UI-of-Apps.pdf" file. 

-> Please note that API 14: Android 4.0 was used to implement these apps. As such, the build configurations of certain apps will need to be modified to older versions. This would include adding older dependencies to the build.gradle file in specific apps. 

-> The concepts and design of these applications were a part of my YorkU Computer Science cirriculum which focused on mobile development.
